# MDK-Toolbox user's guide

The MDK-Toolbox consists of the following utilities:

- **FCARM**, a file converter that reformats web files into a single C source file which is then included and compiled into a project.
- **ElfDwT**, a command-line utility that computes and writes a signature into the application image file.
- **uv2csolution**, a command-line utility that converts ÂµVision projects to [CMSIS solution format](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/YML-Input-Format.md).
- **Mbed TLS/cert_write**, an application that signs a certificate signing request, or self-signs a certificate.
- **Mbed TLS/gen_key**, an application that generates a key for any of the supported public-key algorithms (RSA or ECC).
