- **Mbed TLS/gen_key**, an application that generates a key for any of the supported public-key algorithms (RSA or ECC).

## Documentation

The documentation can be built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). It requires Python 3 to be installed on your local machine.
Check out [Getting Started with MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) to learn how to use it. A CI workflow is
in place that builds the documentation automatically.
